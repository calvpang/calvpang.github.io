## Overview
The Australian Space Summit & Awards was back for its third consequetive year at the International Convention Centre Sydney and The Star Casino to provide an opportunity to showcase Australia's space capabilities.

As part of the Australian Space Data Analysis Facility (ASDAF), nominated for "Earth Observation Program of the Year", I had the opportunity to fly over to Sydney. This gave me the opportunity to learn more about Australia's space industry and network with diverse people from academia, engineering and government.
