## Overview
The Data & AI for Business Conference & Exhibition 2023 hosted by WA Data Science Innovation Hub (WADSIH) is a 2-day event which provided an invaluable opportunity to listen to a diverse list of speakers and panellists, all of whom, subject matter experts in their own field. 

## Curtin Institute for Data Science & ASDAF Booth
As a part of the Curtin Institute for Data Science and Australian Space Data Analytics Facility (ASDAF), I manned the booth and had plenty of opportunities to meet and engage with industry professionals and students within the data science and AI space.
