## Overview
Astrofest is an annual event to provide astronomy enthusiasts, families, and the public to explore the mysteries of the Universe.
Major sponsors include: Curtin University, International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, Scitech, CSIRO & Department of Industry, Science and Resources.

## ASDAF Booth
The Australian Space Data Analytics Facility (ASDAF) hosted a booth at Astrofest, drawing in a huge crowd!
We held colouring in and Lego building competitions for all ages, with Lego prizes up for grabs.
I had multiple opportunities to talk to potential STEM students and job seekers about the burgeoning space industry in Western Australia.
