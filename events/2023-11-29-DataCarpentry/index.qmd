# Overview
The Curtin Institute for Data Science hosts Data Carpentry Workshops twice a year to assist in The Carpentries' mission to build global capacity in essential data and computational skills for research. These workshops aim to provide hands-on teaching and assistance on Git, Python and R to Curtin University researchers and staff.

# Python Workshop
This time around, I received the opportunity to re-write the training material for the Python workshop and had the pleasure to instruct with Nancy Tippaya. Many thanks to the helpers involved!
