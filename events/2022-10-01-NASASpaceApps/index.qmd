## Overview
The [NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://www-2022.spaceappschallenge.org/) is a global hackathon to create solutions to challenges we face on Earth and in space. As part of the Curtin Institute for Computation, I competed in a team called the [Flat Moon Society](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/moonquake-map/teams/flat-moon-society-aus/project) in Perth, Western Australia. We came **first place** in the local selection and received an **honorable mention** as global finalists.

## Moonquake Emergency Warning System
Our solution, [MEWS](https://github.com/calvpang/MEWS) was the Moonquake Emergency Warning System.

It consists of three main components:

1. A centralised and standardised database for the storage and dissemination of moonquake data;
2. A visualisation tool (see demo below) of the 3D moonquake map that we developed to demonstrate the utility of the data as it would be used in one of our apps; and
3. The [Moonquake Emergency Warning System (MEWS)](https://flatmoonsociety.my.canva.site/), the application of our3D moonquake mapping solution in the form of a three-tiered product that provides targeted information to educators, analysts, and remote operators.
