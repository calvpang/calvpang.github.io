    "text": "Real-time Air Quality Monitoring at Murujuga\nA key aspect of the MRAMP involves deploying custom air quality monitoring stations at rock art sites to identify potential risks, such as pollution and climate change.\nAt the symposium, I had the opportunity to present my work titled “Real-time Air Quality Monitoring at Murujuga”. This covered the work done in establishing the infrastructure required to facilitate remote operation, data ingestion and real-time data visualisation for a bespoke air quality monitoring network developed to investigate the impacts of industrial emissions on heritage nominated indigenous petroglyphs."
